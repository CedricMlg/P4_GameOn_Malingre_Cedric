# GameOn project

First of all I'll explain what this context file is all about. <br />
For a year and two month I've been in a formation from OpenClassrooms to become a `JS` and `React` developper. <br />
In this formation every single project is made with a story that you could encounter during your developper life. <br />
I will use the context file to explain my role in the project and what I was supposed to do. <br />
Every repo with a `PXX_ProjectName_LastName_FirstName` is a repo of a project realised during my formation with OpenClassrooms. <br />
Now that this is said let's talk about the project. <br />

## The project

You have recently been hired as a junior front-end developer in a small company, GameOn, which specialises in game conferences and competitions. You have been shadowing your lead developer, Erika, to follow her work on a daily basis.

### My role

For this project I had to finish the code of a project started by one of my colleague, a model, a repo with the base code and some git issues of the work left to do were given to me, I needed to finish the modal, do some tests and add error or confiramtion messages. I used HTML CSS and JavaScript.
